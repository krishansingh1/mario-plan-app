  Mario plan app is a app by which a new user sign in to the database and add there projects. This app is a realtime running app by which we can signin, login, create a new   project, logout functionality. So first thing in this project is started by creating components for different functions like this sequence: <br>
  <p>Components:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>auth</li>
     <ul>
      <li>signin</li>
      <li>signup</li>
     </ul>
   <li>dashboard</li>
     <ul>
      <li>dashboard</li>
     </ul>
   <li>layout</li>
     <ul>
      <li>navbar</li>
      <li>signinlinks</li>
      <li>signoutlinks</li>
     </ul>
   <li>projects</li>
     <ul>
      <li>create projects</li>
      <li>projects details</li>
      <li>projects list</li>
      <li>projects summary</li>
     </ul> 
  </ul>
  <br>
  
  After creating the components I started with the redux part in redux I add reducers and the actions to different for different components. After the redux part i started with firebase i add firebase to the projects so we now don't need the dummy data we can use realtime data which we can add in firebase and deploy it in our app.
